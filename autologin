You can use bash to parse /etc/profile and ~/.profile, and then start fish.

Create /usr/bin/fishlogin with contents

        #!/bin/bash -l
        exec -l fish "$@"
Make it executable

        sudo chmod a+rx /usr/bin/fishlogin

Check that it works by running fishlogin and checking that you end up in a Fish shell. Press Control+D to exit the Fish shell.

Add it to /etc/shells

       echo /usr/bin/fishlogin | sudo tee -a /etc/shells

Set it as your default shell.Under Linux:

       sudo usermod -s /usr/bin/fishlogin $USER
